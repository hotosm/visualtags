  title: About
  about: The HOT Visual Tag Chooser is a companion application to the HOT Export Tool that provides users an easier way to create, edit, and copy preset files. Preset files tell the HOT Export tool what data (places, utilities, public services, land use, etc.) to include in all maps created and exported through the site. This information is saved in a “preset file”, but typically in a format (JOSM Preset XML file) that is not easy to utilize for users not specifically trained in GIS. 
  solution: With the Visual Tag Chooser, users now have multiple options. Expert users can either upload an existing JOSM preset file or make a new file from scratch. New users to the site can utilize existing preset files by copying files. To customize existing preset files, users can add and edit existing tags within the preset. For example, in the image below, more information has been added to the “Restaurant” tag in an existing preset file. 
  you_can: You can upload a JOSM preset, or make a new preset from scratch, or copy an existing one. You can add and edit existing items within the preset. You can add and edit tags or form elements of the Item. For example, the Item "Restaurant" has a text tag "name".
