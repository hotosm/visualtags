  title: About
  about:   The HOT Export tool requires a list of tags to be specified when downloading an extract. This list is generated by a user uploading a JOSM Preset XML file. The preset file is a structured format with groups of tags, translations of tags, defaults etc. Creating and editing a preset is essential for the HOT Exports application. That process is not easy at all for users and involves text editing a raw XML file.
  solution: This application is an attempt for a solution - to create and edit a JOSM preset visually using a more user friendly interface.
  you_can: You can upload a JOSM preset, and be presented with a collection of tags extracted from this.   You can then edit, create and remove tags from this collection.
  can_upload: Upload a new preset
  can_new: Create empty new preset
  can_list: View existing presets
flash:
  created: Preset created!
  updated: Preset updated!
  deleted: Preset deleted!
  cloned: Preset cloned!
