  title: About
  about:   The HOT Export tool requires a list of tags to be specified when downloading an extract. This list is generated by a user uploading a JOSM Preset XML file. The preset file is a structured format with groups of tags, translations of tags, defaults etc. Creating and editing a preset is essential for the HOT Exports application. That process is not easy at all for users and involves text editing a raw XML file.
  solution: This application is an attempt for a solution - to create and edit a JOSM preset visually using a more user friendly interface.
  you_can: You can upload a JOSM preset, or make a new preset from scratch, or copy an existing one. You can add and edit existing items within the preset. You can add and edit tags or form elements of the Item. For example, the Item "Restaurant" has a text tag "name". 
  can_upload: Upload a new preset
  can_new: Create empty new preset
  can_list: View existing presets
  defaults_title: Get Started with a Default Preset
  defaults_text: Get started with choosing one of the default presets. Copy one and then edit, add and remove tags.
