About

Visual Tag Chooser

The HOT Export tool requires a list of tags to be specified when downloading an extract.
This list is generated by a user uploading a JOSM Preset XML file. The preset file is a structured format
with groups of tags, translations of tags, defaults etc. Creating and editing a preset is essential
for the HOT Exports application. That process is not easy at all for users and involves
text editing a raw XML file.

Solution
An application that will create and edit a JOSM preset visually using a more user friendly interface.

Current Version
alpha v0.1

Demo
https://visualtags.herokuapp.com
