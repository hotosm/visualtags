<h2>About </h2>
<p>
  The HOT Export tool requires a list of tags to be specified when downloading an extract.
  This list is generated by a user uploading a JOSM Preset XML file. The preset file is a structured format
  with groups of tags, translations of tags, defaults etc. Creating and editing a preset is essential
  for the HOT Exports application. That process is not easy at all for users and involves
  text editing a raw XML file.
</p>
<p>
  This application is an attempt for a solution - to create and edit a JOSM preset visually
  using a more user friendly interface.
</p>
<p>
  You can upload a JOSM preset, and be presented with a collection of tags extracted from this.
  You can then edit, create and remove tags from this collection.
